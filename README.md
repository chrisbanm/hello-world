# hello-world
The Github tutorial repository.

Here lies a lying repository.

I am the best programmer on earth since I ***never*** make mistakes and always complete my assignments on time. Also, I invented the internet and singlehandedly caused the extinction of the dinosaurs.  **Really, they had it coming!**

Also, I helped Werner Vogels get his start and taught him everthing he knows. But then we all know just how great I am. 

I was thinking of taking over the world. Should I let people just vote me in? That would be sweet, getting the consent of the governed and all. But it doesn't seem to be the way anyone else really does it these days. *Hmm...* Yeah, I think I'll just unleash my superweapon on a couple of large population centers and then accept the unconditional surrender of the nations or absolute annihilation of anyone who doesn't surrender. That's much more like the evil super genius that I am. I really like that idea.

OK so:
- Step 1: Complete this Github *Hello World* tutorial.
- Step 2: Finish deploying my superweapons in space.
- Step 3: Destroy some large population centers. How about Paris, Moscow and Bejing? Maybe Pyongyang too.
- Step 4: Freshen up for my speech to all the former nations of the world.
- Step 5: Give speech and dictate terms.
- Step 6: Accept the unconditional surrender of those willing to do so.
- Step 7: Annihilate everyone else.

Wow, this is actually going to be rather easy. I wonder why someone else didn't think of it?
